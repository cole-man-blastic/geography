  <h1>Do the People of North Muskegon Know Geography?</h1>
  <h1>Let's find out...</h1>
  <h2>The Beginning</h2>
  <div class="block">I was just playing <a href="https://globle-game.com/">globle</a> when I pondered whether or not the game would be playable for normies&mdash;people who don't know the names and relative locations of every country. Considering the known geographic illiteracy of Americans, I'd expect that many people would type "USA", "MEXICO", and then give up after the game refuses to take "AFRICA" as a country. I mean, just look at this map! It's embarrasing really.</div>
  <img class="map" src="images/iran.png">
  <div class="block">Surely there's no way right? The people they interviewed couldn't possibly be from around here; they're probably from Texas or something. I couldn't bear thinking that I might know another human being who would actually guess that Italy was Iran. Still, I had to make sure.</div>
  <img class="globe" src="images/globe.gif">
  <div class="block">I began compiling a sample of questions to ask my classmates at school what they thought the answers were. Here are the results:</div>
  <div class="color-change" data-color="rgb(25, 25, 112)"></div>
  <h2>The First Test</h2>
  <div class="block wide">
    What two countries share the worldâ€™s longest land border?<br>
    Their response was: (hover to reveal)
    <div class="block"><div class="reveal">Russia and China.</div></div>
    The correct answer was:
    <div class="block"><div class="reveal">The United States and Canada.</div></div>
  </div>
  <div class="block wide">
    Which is larger? Russia or China?<br>
    Their response was:
    <div class="block"><div class="reveal">Russia.</div></div>
    The correct answer was:
    <div class="block"><div class="reveal">Russia.</div></div>
  </div>
  <div class="block wide">
    What is the 5th largest country?<br>
    Their response was:
    <div class="block"><div class="reveal">Mexico...or South Africa?</div></div>
    The correct answer was:
    <div class="block"><div class="reveal">Brazil.</div></div>
  </div>
  <div class="block wide">
    What is the most populous country in the world?<br>
    Their response was:
    <div class="block"><div class="reveal">China... wait no it's India now.</div></div>
    The correct answer was:
    <div class="block"><div class="reveal">India.</div></div>
  </div>
  <div class="block wide">
    Dublin is the capital of what country?<br>
    Their response was:
    <div class="block"><div class="reveal">Denmark? I don't know.</div></div>
    The correct answer was:
    <div class="block"><div class="reveal">Ireland.</div></div>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    That last one reminds me of a good dad joke.<br><br>
    Why is Ireland one of the richest countries?<br>
    Because its capital's always Dublin!<br><br>
    Jokes aside, it is unfortunate that despite living so close to the largest land border between two nations, their guess was thrown elsewhere. I mean, it's a straight line!

  <h2>The Interview</h2>
  <div class="block">I sat down with our local Geographic and Flag extraordinaire, Robby Blastic, to try to figure out what was up.</div>
  <img class="selfie" src="images/lad.png">
  <div class="block left">[Me] Why are people so bad at Geography, Robby?</div>
  <div class="block right">[Robby] Because they're stupid.</div>
  <div class="block left">But what causes the stupidity to arise within the American populous?</div>
  <div class="block right">Umm... they have a bad memory.</div>
  <div class="block left">Is that as simple as it is?</div>
  <div class="block right">If you have a bad memory you're not gonna remember where all of the stuff is. Also we don't really learn it in school.</div>
  <div class="block left">You think it has something to do with the US education system, given that it is a pretty American thing.</div>
  <div class="block right">We've learned the continents multiple times.</div>
  <div class="block left">What's a geography fact you'd like to enlighten us with?</div>
  <div class="block right">Well, did you know that Portugal's actually in Europe and not South America...</div>
  <div class="block left">I did know that.</div>
  <div class="block right">...Anna Blastic?</div>
  <div class="block left">She knows that now, but it did take us asking her quite a few times before she finally learned it so we would stop making fun of her. Maybe that's how we make people smarter; we just have to insult them about how dumb they are until they decide to stop being dumb.</div>
  <div class="block right">You could play the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1508wboZXk">Yakko's World</a> song all over and eventually people will remember it.</div>
  <div class="block left">But that song is quite outdated.</div>
  <div class="block right">You could play the more modern geography songs.</div>
  <div class="block left">That would be more effective.</div>
  <div class="block right">And then once you know all the countries you'd automatically pick up on more of the details. You'd hear something on the news and be like "oh, I've heard of that country", so then you'd remember it better.</div>
  <div class="block left">Cool.</div>
  <div class="block">Maybe interviewing a middle schooler right before his bedtime wasn't the best idea, but we managed to get somewhere in the end.</div>
  <div class="color-change" data-color="rgb(0, 0, 0)"></div>
  <h2>Testing Myself</h2>
  <div class="block">I decided to take Robby's idea to heart, and I practiced my geography again using <a href="https://www.geoguessr.com/vgp/3199">Seterra</a> without any skipping. Here's how I did:</div>
  <img class="score" src="images/score.png">
  <img class="map" src="images/seterra.png">
  <div class="block">It's crazy how much knowledge I have been able to retain since the ages it's been since I last took this test. With an hour or two I'd easily get that score up to 100. Anyways, it's time I headed out to single handedly reform the American education system.</div>
